# PerfectFit (IT426-AI Project)
PerfectFit is a project that uses the power of Artificial Intelligence together with Genetic Algorithms to find the ideal outfit for a user. The general idea is that it personalizes clothing recommendations to suit one's style, desired comfort, budget, and color preferences.
